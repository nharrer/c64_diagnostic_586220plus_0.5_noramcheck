# C64 Diagnostic 586220++ noramcheck

This is a modified version of the [586220++ v0.5 diagnostic cart](http://blog.worldofjani.com/?p=1981), which skips all ram checks in order to run through faster.

It is not intended for diagnosing  defective C64s, but to check a test harness on a good C64. Skipping the RAM check speeds up the whole process significantly.

## Compilation 

The project can be loaded and compiled in [C64Studio](https://www.georg-rottensteiner.de/).
